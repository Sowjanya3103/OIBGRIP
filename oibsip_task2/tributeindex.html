            <b>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu</b>(26 August 1910 â€“ 5 September 1997)
            was a Roman Catholic Religious Sister and missionary of Albanian 
            origin who lived for most of her life in India. Mother Teresa 
            founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious 
            congregation, which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and 
            is active in 133 countries. They run hospitals and homes for 
            people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis; kitchens; 
            dispensaries and mobile clinics; children's and family 
            counselling programmes; orphanages; and schools. Members of the 
            order must adhere to the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, 
            and the fourth vow, to give "wholehearted free service to the 
            poorest of the poor" Mother Teresa was the recipient of numerous 
            honours including the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2003, 
            she was beatified as "Blessed Teresa of Calcutta".
